# The main functionality offered through this script is going to be
# installation/placement of all the things for the Sora Evolution voices and
# scripts.
#
# Since this game has two versions, and a configuration launcher for each, Steam
# presents the user with a dialog for selecting what to run when clicking the
# Play button in Steam.
#
# When launching this game from the command line or a steam:// URL, however, it
# will always launch the DX9 game executable. So launching the game from Lutris
# doesn't really serve much purpose.

# Configure Steam first before executing this script.
# Do one of the following to enable Proton Compatiblity layer
# * Steam Menu -> Settings -> Steam Play -> Advanced -> Enable Steam Play for
#   all other titles
#    - Run other titles with: Proton 7.0-x (or 6.3-x)
# OR
# * Library -> The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (Right Click) ->
#   Properties
#    - Compatibility -> Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatiblity tool
#    - Select Proton 7.0 (or 6.3)
# Set Launch options to:
# WINEDLLOVERRIDES="dinput8.dll=n,b" %command%

# Procedure for installation via Lutris
#  1. Click + (Add Game button)
#  2. Select "Install from a local install script"
#  3. Browse to where this script is downloaded and select it.
#  4. Select Install
#  5. Browse to all of the files that need to be browsed to, selecting each file
#     accordingly.
#  6. Lutris will execute Steam to install Trails in the Sky FC.
#  7. Click through installation dialog in Steam.
#  8. Wait for the download to complete.
#  9. Wait for the other processes in Lutris to complete, and Lutris returns
#     saying everything is OK.
# 10. Lutris will run Config.exe.
# 10. Configure the game as desired, and save.
# 11. Start the game from Steam.

        # CAUTION: Lutris 0.5.8.3 (and probably other versions as well) has a
        # critical issue with ordering of assets here. Specifically, if
        # automated downloads are listed *AFTER* manually browsed files, then
        # Lutris silently refuses to continue with the installation process
        # after the user finishes manually browsing those files and presses the
        # "Confirm" button. Since this is insane, we circumvent this by listing
        # automated downloads *BEFORE* manually browsed files. See also:
