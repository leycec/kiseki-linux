    # This version intentionally does *NOT* contain the magic substring "GOG",
    # as doing so magically enables non-ideal GOG integration in Lutris. Since
    # GOG users commonly prefer to manage GOG downloads themselves rather than
    # implicitly through Lutris, the current approach is typically preferable.
    # GOG users that prefer Lutris to manage GOG downloads are encouraged to
    # add "GOG" to this version *AND* this line to the "game:" section below:
    #     gogid: 1207665083
    # Note also that GOG integration was broken for nearly a year throughout
    # the Lutris 0.5.8.x lifecycle, which does *NOT* inspire confidence here.

        # CAUTION: Lutris 0.5.8.3 (and probably other versions as well) has a
        # critical issue with ordering of assets here. Specifically, if
        # automated downloads are listed *AFTER* manually browsed files, then
        # Lutris silently refuses to continue with the installation process
        # after the user finishes manually browsing those files and presses the
        # "Confirm" button. Since this is insane, we circumvent this by listing
        # automated downloads *BEFORE* manually browsed files. See also:

        #installers again. Unfortunately, Lutris 0.5.8.x fundamentally broke
        #support for these installers by copying installer files into isolated
        #cache directories and then attempting to extract and/or run those
        #files from those directories. We currently circumvent this by
        #requiring users to manually select *ALL* parts of multi-part GOG
        #installers, which we then recombine back into a single cache directory
        #with absurd symlinking. While awful, this works. Since this is awful,
        #however, we would prefer to undo this as soon as Lutris fixes itself.
